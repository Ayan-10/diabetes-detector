# Diabetes Detector AI
**Diabetes Detector AI** is a lightweight, intelligent web application that analyzes medical prescriptions and lab reports to detect signs of diabetes using OCR and AI. Users simply upload their report photo, and the system determines the likelihood of diabetes based on extracted data â€” categorized into RED, YELLOW, or GREEN status levels.
ðŸ’¡ Bonus: If the report lacks critical data (e.g., glucose levels), the AI will prompt the user to provide missing information.
